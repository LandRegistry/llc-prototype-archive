            <p>Use this service to search for legal rights and restrictions (local land charges) on land or property.</p>
            <p>An inspection of the Local Land Charges Register is free under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR).</p>
            <p>The official search, the search of local land charges guaranteed by HM Land Registry, does not include things like planning and development applications, building controls, or information about of road development schemes near to your property.
                Ask your conveyancer for a CON 29 search to get this information.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">What are local land charges?</h2>
            <p>Local land charges are legal rights and restrictions on land. For example, a tree preservation order is a local land charge that stops you from cutting down a tree.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">Why you need to search for local land charges</h2>
            <p>If you are thinking about buying a house, you need to find out if it has any local land charges on it. This is because local land charges affect what you can do on a property.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">Difference between the free and official searches
            </h2>
            <p>There are 2 types of search. One is free, the other costs £15. This search is an official search, guaranteed by HM Land Registry. This gives you more information about local land charges.</p>
            <p>You must create an account to get the extra benefits from a paid search.</p>
